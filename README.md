# CS470-Artificial-Intelligence
This class was taken and completed at the University of Idaho during the Summer 2020 semester. There were 4 major projects that each included a write up. The first three projects were performed in python and consisted of searches, having a artificial intelligence agent use the mini-max algorithm to play connect 4, and solving the map coloring constraint sastisfaction problem. The fourth project was using the logical programming language Prolog and creating a knowledge base that understood geneology (family relationships). This project also required us to run queries on our knowledge base to ensure that it was working correctly.
